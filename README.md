## 1. Design and Development

For the design of this <application>, the 5 pillars of User Experience Design (UXD) were used to cover the strategy, scope, structure, skeleton and surface to make sure the design is intuitive, simple and enjoyable.

### 1.1 Strategy

Initial interviews with the stakeholder were conducted to understand their high-level requirements for the app. This allowed further research to be conducted into user profiles / groups benefitting.

The target user audience…

Competitor research was then carried out...

### 1.2 Scope

A brainstorming session was held with the customer to generate user themes and epics, which user stories can then be generated from. Once the user stories had been generated and confirmed, they were prioritised and time bound. For a full list of all user stories, please click [here](https://github.com/AlyshaJohnson/project-portfolio-4/issues?q=).

The SP, or Story Point, is a relative prediction of the time taken to complete the user story against a baseline. The baseline user story was <insert user story>.

To complete all user stories, the predicted time it would take would be <insert no of weeks> weeks. As the customer required a release date of the 1st December 2022, a minimum set of user stories were agreed and reviewed weekly based on <insert no. of SPs> story points possible in the time frame. The final agreed set of user stories were:

User story #    Title   Description Priority    SP Epic

### 1.3 Structure

From the user stories, content, data, features and functionality can be determined.

**For the content:**


**Data Model:**


**For the features / functionality:**


### 1.4 Skeleton

When the structure of the app, features and data model had been determined, a wireframe for each view could be created:

<insert view of app/website>

### 1.5 Surface

**Colour Palette**

![Colour Palette](./assets/images/readme/color.jpeg)

- The quiz's primary colours are (from left to right) #13443E, #EFEFEF, #F4D1AF and #E86E4C as seen in the picture above. They were derived using the online tool [colormind](http://colormind.io/), to make sure they complement and contrast. The colors are all nuances of green or orange, to mirror nature and enhance the connection with the being green.
- #13443E is used for headlines and text throughtout the quiz, unless a hyperlink, and as a border colour to emphasise buttons or sections of text. On hover and selection, all buttons turn the colour #13443E to show they are active. It is also used, in conjunction with an opacity of 0.5, as an overlay when the instructions pop-up is active.
- #EFEFEF is used as the main background colour for the webpage, the instructions pop up and on buttons. On selection or hover on buttons, the text is changed to #EFEFEF to contrast with it's background.
- #F4D1AF is used as a contrasting background color for the question and results sections.
- #E86E4C is used minimally to highlight links away from the quiz. It is a brighter colour to contrast with the green.

**Typography**
- Quicksand is used for headings and header elements. The fallback font is sans serif.
- Dosis is used for all other text elements including paragraphs, button labels, lists, etc. The fallback font is sans serif.
- Both fonts are from Google Fonts.

## 3. Features

### 3.1 Existing Features

The features deployed for this quiz are as follows:

<insert feature descriptions and images>

### 3.2 Future Features

There is an addition of <insert no. of weeks> weeks worth of work still to perform to give the customer everything they require. This includes the following user stories:

User story #    Title   Description Priority    SP Epic

## 4. Testing

Multiple layers of testing were performed on this project including:
- TDD testing
- Bug capturing during development
- Input form validation
- API mocking
- Code validation testing 
- User experience tesing

### 4.1 Initial Developer Testing

As the project was developed and coded, developer testing was conducted to reduce the impact of bugs and errors in the code. This testing consisted of general debugging of written code based off gitpod IDE recommendations; running through input validator testing scenarios to check for input errors; and testing on different browsers.

**General Debugging**

Bugs were captured throughout the course of the project using the 'issues' object within GitHub. 

**Input Validator Testing**

**Browser / Device testing**

The development of this app was conducted on Google Chrome, therefore extensive testing was conducted on this browser. This was used as a benchmark against Firefox and Safari.

The elements of testing conducted on each browser are:
<insert list of testing performed and why - see example below>
- User Experience - what does the quiz look like; is the flow through the quiz the same; are all elements where they are expected?
- Functionality - do the buttons work as expected; does the question counter count?
- Performance - how responsive is the site?

The user experience is consistent on Chrome, Firefox and Safari. The instruction videos in Safari do not load - this bug has been captured.

Responsive design is important, CSS code had to be amended and adjusted to make sure the app could work on a number of devices. There were a number of user experience bugs that were produced when testing. These have now been fixed in the code.

### 4.2 Code Validation Testing

Using tools such as W3C validator, Jigsaw and Lighthouse gives visibility of any code, scripts or elements that are causing any errors. The results for the site are as follows:

**HTML**
- <insert report number> errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](<insert link to report>)

**CSS**
- <insert report number> errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](<insert link to report>)

**JS**
- [JSHint](https://jshint.com/) was used to check for errors in the JS code.
- For script.js, there were <insert report number> errors and <insert report number> warnings.
- For instructions.js, there were <insert report number> errors and <insert report number> warnings.
<insert any methods used to reduce number of errors and warnings>

**Performance**
- Results can be seen through the official [Lighthouse](<insert link to report>) report.

As part of the performance test through Lighthouse, some changes were made:
- Accessibility (aria-label) tags were implemented on all buttons to improve the score from 82 to 100.
- The cache policy was amended to increase the length of number of seconds the browser should cache the resource.
- The image file sizes needed to be compressed so reduce the impact on performance. This was successfully done using [tinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/).

### 4.3 User Testing
This app has been tested by a small group of 10 users in which some feedback was captured in the design and some errors in functionality and spelling were corrected.

UI improvements made:
