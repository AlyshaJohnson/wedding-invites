## 1. Design and Development

For the design of this Wedding Invite app, the 5 pillars of User Experience Design (UXD) were used to cover the strategy, scope, structure, skeleton and surface to make sure the design is intuitive, simple and enjoyable.

### 1.1 Strategy

Initial interviews with the stakeholder were conducted to understand their high-level requirements for the app. This allowed further research to be conducted into user profiles / groups benefitting.

The target user audienceâ€¦

Competitor research was then carried out...

### 1.2 Scope

A brainstorming session was held with the customer to generate user themes and epics, which user stories can then be generated from. Once the user stories had been generated and confirmed, they were prioritised and time bound. For a full list of all user stories, please click [here](https://github.com/AlyshaJohnson/project-portfolio-4/issues?q=).

The SP, or Story Point, is a relative prediction of the time taken to complete the user story against a baseline. The baseline user story was "Create Account".

To complete all user stories, the predicted time it would take would be 8 weeks. As the customer required a release date of the 1st December 2022, a minimum set of user stories were agreed and reviewed weekly. The final agreed set of user stories were:

| USER STORY # | TITLE                            | PRIORITY |
|--------------|----------------------------------|----------|
| #3           | Add new guest                    | Mo       |

### 1.5 Surface

**Colour Palette**

![Colour Palette](/static/media/readme_images/colors.jpg)

- The app's primary colours are (from left to right) #E05F72, #BD8185, #FFF5F6 and #A2B597 as seen in the picture above. These are based of the dark pink colour extracted from the background image.Then using the online tool [colorspace](https://mycolor.space/) to generate the others, to make sure they complement and contrast.
- #E05F72 is one of the main colours in the background image, and was used to generate the colour theme.
- #BD8185 is used as the font colour through the majority of the site. It is also used as the border colour in the header and on icon buttons in the nav bar.
- #FFF5F6 is used as the main background colour on the div-cards to contrast the background image.
- #A2B597 is used as the button and link colour.

**Typography**
- Petit Formal Script is used for headings and header elements. The fallback font is cursive.
- Nunito Sans is used for all other text elements including paragraphs, button labels, lists, etc. The fallback font is sans serif.
- Both fonts are from Google Fonts.

## 4. Testing

Multiple layers of testing were performed on this project including:
- Bug capturing during development
- Input form validation
- Code validation testing 
- User experience tesing

### 4.1 Initial Developer Testing

As the project was developed and coded, developer testing was conducted to reduce the impact of bugs and errors in the code. This testing consisted of general debugging of written code based off gitpod IDE recommendations; running through input validator testing scenarios to check for input errors; and testing on different browsers.

**General Debugging**

Bugs were captured throughout the course of the project using the 'issues' object within GitHub. 

**Input Validator Testing**

**Browser / Device testing**

The development of this app was conducted on Google Chrome, therefore extensive testing was conducted on this browser. This was used as a benchmark against Firefox and Safari.

The elements of testing conducted on each browser are:
<insert list of testing performed and why - see example below>
- User Experience - what does the quiz look like; is the flow through the quiz the same; are all elements where they are expected?
- Functionality - do the buttons work as expected; does the question counter count?
- Performance - how responsive is the site?

The user experience is consistent on Chrome, Firefox and Safari. The instruction videos in Safari do not load - this bug has been captured.

Responsive design is important, CSS code had to be amended and adjusted to make sure the app could work on a number of devices. There were a number of user experience bugs that were produced when testing. These have now been fixed in the code.

### 4.2 Code Validation Testing

Using tools such as W3C validator, Jigsaw and Lighthouse gives visibility of any code, scripts or elements that are causing any errors. The results for the site are as follows:

**HTML**
- <insert report number> errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](<insert link to report>)

**CSS**
- <insert report number> errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](<insert link to report>)

**JS**
- [JSHint](https://jshint.com/) was used to check for errors in the JS code.
- For script.js, there were <insert report number> errors and <insert report number> warnings.
- For instructions.js, there were <insert report number> errors and <insert report number> warnings.
<insert any methods used to reduce number of errors and warnings>

**Performance**
- Results can be seen through the official [Lighthouse](<insert link to report>) report.

As part of the performance test through Lighthouse, some changes were made:
- Accessibility (aria-label) tags were implemented on all buttons to improve the score from 82 to 100.
- The cache policy was amended to increase the length of number of seconds the browser should cache the resource.
- The image file sizes needed to be compressed so reduce the impact on performance. This was successfully done using [tinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/).

### 4.3 User Testing
This app has been tested by a small group of 10 users in which some feedback was captured in the design and some errors in functionality and spelling were corrected.

UI improvements made:
- <list any improvements to UI that were made here>

Errors / bug fixes:
- <list errors/bugs that were found, what the problem was and how they were fixed>

### 4.4 Unfixed Bugs
